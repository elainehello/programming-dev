What are Backend Architeture Designs?
	The process of defining the modularity, interfaces, and data flow for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
	Modularity just means to break down these components in the way that works best for the problem trying to be solved,
	sometimes can mean one module or many modules (decision making is up-to-you)
	
	Interfaces is the in and out of the system or the architecture, how the systems or backends communicate with each other.
	standardise the interfaces being used.
	using as main protocol gRPC and shifting to REST (not to be done unless justified), similar interfaces across all the of the systems.
	
	Data flow which modularity interfaces impact your dataflow
